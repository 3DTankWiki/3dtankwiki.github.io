</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h3><p>Greetings, 坦克手们. On this occasion, we're moving onto the subject of flipping, which is pretty self-explanatory - the point where your 坦克 isn't right-side-up. It isn't exactly something you see intentionally done in 战斗; when it happens, it's more due to your own serendipity, or, to be blunt, awful maneuvering from the opposing 团队's part. How can it affect 战斗 though? That's what this article aims to tell you - it also aims to provide an insight on the importance of flipping, the situations in which a 玩家 can flip another 玩家, and whether you should kill a flipped 坦克.</p><p><br>
</p><h3><span id="Why_is_flipping_important.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_is_flipping_important?">Why is flipping important?</span></h3><p>A flipped 坦克 is one less active 坦克 on the battlefield, which means, for a short period of time, there are more 玩家 on your side contributing to the ultimate goal; winning. You may be thinking that 10 seconds (less than that, in the average circumstances) isn't a lot, but when racked with the time it takes to respawn, and the time it takes to get back into the action, it becomes a lot more substantial than initially thought. There's a 原因 why people complain when people continue to play despite the sides not being equal - it's because so much as one less 玩家, even if temporary, makes the difference, as it takes a chunk of the 团队 out. I'll use an example - the 玩家 flipped is a 守卫者, and when unable to move, that 守卫者 cannot 帮助 out in the way that they'd like to. This leaves the defense largely exposed, which makes it much easier for the opposing offense to successfully attack. It's the numbers game - something that the 团队 with the advantage can turn into a real problem if handled correctly.<br>
</p><p>For the 经验值 readers, you'll know that when an opponent is flipped, you may see "-1" pop around the 聊天 - this implies that there is a flipped 玩家 on the battlefield and that you can capitalize. That's what a flipped 坦克 can enable you to do - it provides that opportunity for you to gain momentum and seize 控制 of the match. When you've flipped, after pressing Del, type in "-" (in your 团队's 聊天, I'll add) to let your teammates know that you're down. In sum, a flipped 坦克 is a lot more fundamental than meets the eye, in regards to how it can affect the 未来世界 of the game; when you see a flipped 坦克, definitely look to capitalize.</p><p><br>
</p><h3><span id="How_can_I_flip_someone_effectively.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="How_can_I_flip_someone_effectively?">How can I flip someone effectively?</span></h3><p>There are a few ways in which you can deliberately flip people - one thing to note is that it's not easy to flip someone and that in the average situation, you won't be able to do it. You'll only be able to flip an opposing side in particular scenarios - it will involve capitalizing on an enemy's actions, and in most cases, you will need to be swift in doing it, otherwise, you'll miss the opportunity to do so.</p><p><br>
</p><h4><span id="Capitalising_on_an_enemy.27s_jump"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Capitalising_on_an_enemy's_jump">Capitalising on an enemy's jump</span></h4><p>The first method is via taking advantage of an enemy jumping off a cliff. This is one of the more 普通 methods of flipping someone, since jumping off cliffs is frequently used to get to a specific destination faster. Another thing I would like to mention is that most of these methods will not work if you have a 炮塔 such a 冰风暴, 火焰炮, and 磁力炮 - the reasoning should speak for itself. The shot from your 炮塔 will be the way you go about getting the flip, for the most part.<br>
</p><p>It's also pretty easy - in most cases, all you're going to need to do is hit the 坦克, which, needless to say, isn't so much to ask. 激光炮 will do the job with a single shot if handled correctly, but with weapons like 轰天炮, 雷暴炮, and 滑膛炮, one shot will only get them side-up, which isn't all doom-and-gloom, due to the fact it's going to take nothing more than another shot to get the full flip. Be careful how you go when facing higher cliffs - whilst there's a higher 几率 that it will take a single shot to flip completely since there's more 宇宙 between the cliff and floor, you need to remember that it's possible the 坦克 can land right-side-up - never think that because you have managed to get the shot, you've got the flip, as that might not always be the case. The solution to this is to wait - don't 射击 as soon as the opposing 玩家 has jumped. Hold it off for just a bit; this means there's a lower 几率 of the enemy landing right-side-up, due to there being less 宇宙 between the cliff the enemy jumped from and the floor below. Don't leave it too long either - if you leave it too late, from your 职务, you might not be able to land the shot, and the result of the flip might not be what you expected! Examine the length of the cliff and time your shot accordingly to ascertain the flip.</p><p><br>
</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_your_impact_force">Using your 冲击力</span></h4><p>Using your 冲击力 - I already know what you're thinking! In the average scenario, this is not going to work unless you're using a 激光炮 against another 激光炮 user. At the same time, this 激光炮 user will ALSO need to be a 黄蜂轻甲 user. You would be right in saying that, and they're pretty specific circumstances too; however, I've decided to include it here because it is also 普通 (经验值/BPs and the like). Bear in mind it won't be the easiest method to conduct.<br>
</p><p>You want to be 瞄准 for the 炮塔. The 原因 why you want to be shooting for the opposing 玩家's 炮塔 is that your 冲击力 works strongest there - the shot will have a much more detrimental effect up top rather than down below. Here's the problem, though - that won't be enough! Due to recent updates, a 激光炮-黄蜂轻甲 will be able to remain right-side-up after the shot. In order to get the flip, you'll need to play the mind games - in 其他 words, you will have to predict your opponent's shot by shooting before them, which isn't easy, by any means. Although it will give you a match advantage, getting the prediction alone won't give you the flip! Your shot and your opponent's shot will need to work in 串联, in order to get the flip. If you play 经验值/BP commonly, as you improve in the 格式, the opportunities will come.</p><p><br>
</p><h4><span id="Capitalising_on_an_enemy.27s_failure"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Capitalising_on_an_enemy's_failure">Capitalising on an enemy's failure</span></h4><p>You know there are incompetent 坦克手们 out there that cannot drive to save their lives and will find themselves side-up, waiting for their weapon to reload (or if they're using a 火焰炮, 磁力炮, or 冰风暴, to self-destruct), and you can capitalize on it! Don't be afraid to do so.<br>
</p><p>You want to be shooting the top of the 底盘 to guarantee the flip - any 炮塔 that 射击 out as opposed to spraying out will work here and provided you 射击 at the top of the 底盘 as I've said, it will only take one shot! One thing I'd like you to let you know, though, is that if the opposing 玩家 is using 火焰炮, 磁力炮, or 冰风暴, you won't always need to bother. This is because they cannot do anything to revert their catastrophe - in essence, it's like the 坦克 is fully flipped. Of course, you can argue that 红队 can un-flip their teammates with their longer 射程炮塔, effectively solving the problem for them. Therefore, whether you should do it comes down to priorities of the user, the tactical awareness of the enemy, and the 炮塔 you're using - the 炮塔 matters because the reload varies!</p><p><br>
</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pushing">Pushing</span></h4><p>Finally, here's the last method that I'd like to show you here when it comes to flipping a 坦克 - pushing. Hey! No one said you cannot push your 红队! You know what they say - giving them a nudge in the right direction! However, I certainly haven't saved the best for last - it's not the most effective way of getting the job done.<br>
</p><p>You should only bother if your opponent is on the edge of a cliff or incline - it'll be easier if the opponent isn't aware of your presence either. Although there are incompetent 坦克手们 out there, opponents still have their eyes on you, watching your every move like a hawk! That's why this method isn't the best way to go about things - it isn't 普通, and it isn't always reliable. However, if you're able to creep up on an unsuspecting enemy, who just so happens to be near a cliff or incline, do it. Do it for all of us.</p><p><br>
</p><h3><span id="Is_it_worth_all_the_effort_though.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Is_it_worth_all_the_effort_though?">Is it worth all the effort though?</span></h3><p>By now, we have established that a flipped 坦克 can be fundamental to the outcome of a match - however, this article isn't encouraging you to go into 战斗, finding the opportunities. In actual fact, these opportunities should be finding you. If the opportunity presents itself, go for it - the advantages will pay off. I don't want you to think flipping is all that it's about, although it is pretty important!</p><p><br>
</p><h3><span id="Destroyed_flipped_tanks_-_do_we_bother.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Destroyed_flipped_tanks_-_do_we_bother?">Destroyed flipped 坦克 - do we bother?</span></h3><p>This is the ultimate question - when a 坦克 is flipped, do we destroy it? Now, given the advantages a flipped 坦克 gives, the answer to that is No. I know it can be tempting to do so, bearing in mind you get 免费 points, which can make the difference between one's 职务 on the leaderboard, which will lead to more 水晶. However, I believe that you should 控制 yourself and not do it - forget the five points you'll get, try to nab the 旗子, or simply take out 其他红队! One less 玩家 leaves the 红队 in a much more vulnerable state! Those five points will seem like nothing when taking into 账号 the points you'll get. In destroying the 坦克, you'll be cutting off the time the enemy is out of action, which isn't the right play to make.<br>
</p><p>Don't get into the perception that the respawn time will be enough - whilst it's possible it will be, you want to take advantage of this opportunity as much as possible. Leaving them stuck there maximizes the advantage you'll get!</p><p><br>
</p><h3><span id="What_about_Deathmatches.3F"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="What_about_Deathmatches?">What about 死亡混战?</span></h3><p>This is definitely fair - you're on your own on the battlefield, with no one to rely on, and getting kills is the 钥匙 to winning. Let's not sugarcoat it here - when we go in a 战斗, the 上将 aim is to win. Any advantages simply do not apply when in the 死亡混战 scenario - does that make it okay to destroy a flipped 坦克? Is this the one circumstance where destroying a flipped 坦克 doesn't end up hindering you in any fashion? To be honest, yes - however, before doing so, take into 账号 a couple of things. How much health points does your enemy have? How much 防护 does your enemy have against your 炮塔? It wouldn't be so wise to bother using up your charge, or wasting a shot on an enemy that you know has full HP, as it leaves you dry for 红队 that aren't flipped. 红队 with good 防护 against you might not even get you the kill, if they're bulky, which they tend to be in 死亡混战 - once again, this can leave you dry for 红队 that aren't flipped.<br>
</p><p>You're a bit freer if you're a 轰天炮, 离子炮, or 雷暴炮 as the reload isn't as much of an issue; however, you should definitely still be aware of your surroundings.</p><p><br>
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h3><p>In a 团队 situation, do not waste your time destroying a flipped 坦克.<br>
</p><p>In a solo situation, it's acceptable, but you've got to make sure it's worth doing so.</p><div align="right"><small>Last Edit: HelpersBot 5/21/2024</small></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha512-v2CJ7UaYy4JwqLDIrZUI/4hqeoQieOmAZNXBeQyjo21dadnwR+8ZaIJVT8EE2iyI61OV8e6M8PP2/4hpQINQ/g==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
