</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h3><p>Greetings, 坦克手们! So, you're up against a skilled 激光炮 user who can leap from behind cover and pulverize your health bar in a matter of seconds. Many 玩家 would be defenseless in such a situation. Only those who can think on their feet, or rather tracks, would be able to pull off maneuvers which could turn the tables, and leave the aforementioned 激光炮 outfoxed and embarrassed. Therefore, I've decided to share with you some of the best tips you could use when placed in such a situation, in order to encourage you to take a closer look at the tactics within 3D坦克.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Feinting">Feinting</span></h3><p>- Use: Widespread<br>- 底盘 required: Any<br>- Weapons required: Any<br>- Difficulty 等级: Easy to medium<br>- Efficiency: Moderate<br>
</p><p>This is a 普通 trick used by many 玩家. Basically, it involves poking your 坦克 out of cover for a short period of time in order to make a 激光炮 believe you are leaving cover, and so he would 射击. You would then return the vulnerable part of your 坦克 to behind cover, and the 激光炮 would inevitably miss. This is good as a moderately easy way of making a 激光炮 miss his shot. However, a skilled 激光炮 might manage to hit you before you can hide if you reveal too much of your 坦克 to his 射程. As well as this, if you repetitively move part of your 坦克 in and out of cover, a skilled 激光炮 might time your 移动, and 射击 as you leave cover, based on an estimate of when you'll do so. Therefore, it's always best to be erratic when practicing this maneuver, or your timing can be predicted.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ghosting">Ghosting</span></h3><p>- Use: Widespread in 经验值/BP, Not often in non 格式战斗<br>- 底盘 required: 底盘 with equal or more 速度 than the opposing 激光炮<br>- Weapons required: Any<br>- Difficulty 等级: Easy<br>- Efficiency: Excellent<br>
</p><p>This tactic is used all the time in 经验值/BP 战斗. It takes advantage of the time between the 坦克 spawning and materialising. During this short period of time you can drive into and through 其他坦克. Use this to your advantage by driving into your enemy 坦克 while still in "ghost" 模式. Hopefully, they will 射击 thinking you will materialise and they will get an early hit. If you manage to get inside their 底盘, shooting you becomes impossible. They will miss the shot and you can quickly get out, materialize and get a 免费, easy shot on your opponent.</p><p>An example can be found<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/SjEiI1ai7lA?t=2m30s">here</a>
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_recoil">Using 后坐力</span></h3><p>- Use: Moderate<br>- Weapons required: 轰天炮, 离子炮, 激光炮, 雷暴炮, 火龙珠, 镭射炮.<br>- 底盘 required: Any<br>- Difficulty: Medium to hard<br>- Efficiency: Very good<br>
</p><p>This tactic is used a fair amount, especially in higher-ranked 战斗. It takes advantage of the delay between the charging up and shooting of a 激光炮 by using a weapon with 后坐力 to knock the 激光炮's 坦克 off-balance, thus making his aim go awry. This is easier when against lighter/medium 底盘, and more difficult to execute against heavy 底盘 such as 泰坦 or 猛犸象, as the 后坐力 affects them less. Conversely, this tactic may be countered, or made more difficult to perform successfully, by a skilled 激光炮瞄准 and charging his weapon by hitting 宇宙 when behind cover, and then moving out of cover just before 射击. Also, if you 射击 too early when using a weapon with a longer 炮弹重装时间, a 激光炮 might have time to correct his aim before he 射击, even after having been thrown off-balance. Finally, it is harder to to throw a 激光炮's aim off when he is backed up against a prop for stability.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding_out">Holding out</span></h3><p>- Use: Moderate<br>- Weapons required: Close-ranged - 火焰炮, 磁力炮, 冰风暴<br>- 底盘 requires: Any<br>- Difficulty: Easy<br>- Efficiency: Moderate<br>
</p><p>This is a tactic which involves one thing: patience. In summary, it involves you hiding behind cover, and a 激光炮 staring right at your 职务, waiting for you to show yourself. After maybe 15 or so seconds, the average 激光炮 user starts to lose interest, and turns away to fire at someone else, doing so soon after. That is when you leave cover, and obliterate the poor 激光炮, who'll have forgotten you even existed and would be desperately jamming his index finger into his 宇宙 bar to no avail.</p><p>This tactic is not effective if you have any 其他 weapon than those listed above, as the 'using 后坐力' maneuver would be a lot more helpful in that situation. Surprisingly, this tactic isn't used as much as you would think, as many close-ranged weapon users lack patience, and so 激光炮 users can usually out-wait these 玩家, shooting them as they leave cover. In contrast, a decent 激光炮 user would simply need to try to back away and find cover if this tactic were to be performed successfully on him, and to be prepared to hold a stalemate or to charge a close-ranged 玩家 with 低 health in order to avoid the situation in the first place. Consequently, this tactic is only moderately effective.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ramming">Ramming</span></h3><p>- Use: Not often<br>- Weapons required: Any, but 离子炮 is very useful<br>- 底盘 required: Any, but 底盘 with tracks that stick out (独裁者, 维京, 猎人中甲) can 帮助<br>- Difficulty: Easy with 离子炮, otherwise hard<br>- Efficiency: Good<br>
</p><p>Similar to using 后坐力, the idea of this maneuver is to throw a 激光炮's aim off. But in contrast to the 后坐力 tactic, ramming does so by forcing a 激光炮 to 射击 above you. This tactic is pretty popular with 离子炮 users, as 离子炮 significant 后坐力 when 射击 constantly makes this easier and more effective. What this involves is trying to push into a 激光炮's side in order to tip him slightly, causing him to miss by shooting over you. Unfortunately, this is only really effective when against 黄蜂轻甲, 蜂王, or 独裁者, as the 其他底盘 are larger and have flat bases with centres of 铁塔 in the middle, meaning more stability. Also, this is rarely effective when ramming a 激光炮's front or back, as the force is applied over a smaller area.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_slopes">Using slopes</span></h3><p>- Use: Limited<br>- Weapons required: Any<br>- 底盘 required: Any except 黄蜂轻甲<br>- Difficulty: Medium<br>- Efficiency: Good<br>
</p><p>Like ramming, using slopes involves using your 底盘 to force a 激光炮 to miss. Unlike ramming, this includes the usage of the inclination of the ground, or put simply, slopes. You could always jump down to a lower 等级 to avoid a 激光炮 shot, but that is often not an option. Back to the maneuver, there are two possible situations here. The first is that a 激光炮 is on a slope, and you are above. Here, you would face the ramp head on, and when the 激光炮 drives upwards to the point at which the ground 等级 out, you would push into the front of his 坦克, eventually flipping him over backwards. If the 激光炮 tries to fire, he will most likely 射击 over you, and end up flipping sooner due to his own 后坐力.</p><p>The second scenario is when you are on a slope, and a 激光炮 is on the 等级 ground at the top. Again, you should wait for the 激光炮 to drive towards you to the top point of the ramp, and then you should push upwards into him, forcing him to fire above you if he tries to 射击. However, once the 激光炮 has fired, you should reverse back down the ramp away from pushing the 激光炮 so you can't be tipped yourself, and then counter-attack. Both of these methods are fairly effective, and rely on timing to get them right. On the 其他 hand, a skilled 激光炮 would be patient enough to hold a stalemate, and so would avoid attacking first and ramming into you at the top of a slope, as his long-reload weapon just isn't suitable for close-up situations involving slopes of the terrain.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Balancing_act">Balancing act</span></h3><p>- Use: Very 珍奇<br>- Weapons needed: Any but 磁力炮 for defending version, any for attacking version<br>- 底盘 needed: For defending version, heavy/medium 底盘 (except 独裁者); for attacking  version, light 底盘<br>- Difficulty: Very hard<br>- Efficiency: Excellent<br>
</p><p>So, where else is beyond a 激光炮's 射程? We have discovered using cover, slopes, and ramming to limit a 激光炮's 射程, but there is one place left. This is directly above or below the 激光炮. Again, there are two scenarios. One is that you are defending an area at a lower 等级, and a 激光炮 jumps down towards you in order to finish you off. Here, you would drive towards the spot at which the 激光炮 will land rather than trying to escape, and so he would land on your 坦克. You could then use your weapon (not 磁力炮, as this requires access to the enemy's 炮塔) to attack the 激光炮 from underneath. The 激光炮 will try to get off you in order to fire at you, and so you should try to mimic his 移动 for as long as possible to prevent this. If the 激光炮 does fire, he will definitely miss, and you can simply throw him off you to make attacking him easier.</p><p>The 其他 situation is that in which you are attacking, and there is a 激光炮 below, waiting for you. Here, you should try to land on top of the 激光炮, and once you have, you should balance upon the 激光炮 until he fires, which he almost certainly shall if you entice him to by moving on top of his 炮塔. You could always lay a 地雷 as soon as you land on top of the 激光炮 to 伤害 him from beneath, but if he moves away too quickly, if it's a NS 战斗, or if you don't have 地雷, then this wouldn't be possible. Anyway, when he charges his weapon up, move away from his 炮塔, and avoid balancing in a 职务 in front of the barrel - he should miss by shooting below you. You can then drive off him, and attack.</p><p>However, the 激光炮 in the defending situation would inevitably be using a light 底盘 to attack you, and may use his 速度 to his advantage in order to move off you. In the attacking situation, the only limitation is that it will not work against a 黄蜂轻甲. As well as this, a very skilled 激光炮 would simply avoid 射击 when you are on top of him, as he would realize that neither you nor him would be able to attack each 其他 very successfully anyway. In summary, there are very difficult tactics to use, but can be extremely effective if executed well, and show a lot of 能力.</p><div align="right"><small>Last Edit: HelpersBot 5/21/2024</small></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha512-v2CJ7UaYy4JwqLDIrZUI/4hqeoQieOmAZNXBeQyjo21dadnwR+8ZaIJVT8EE2iyI61OV8e6M8PP2/4hpQINQ/g==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
