After all, the way I always talk about 军团 and how certain 军团 work and how the 军团 system operates could become boring. Most 坦克手 see no 原因 why they should be in a 军团. After all, is it not just a pain in the neck that distracts you from getting on and playing the game? Well, some people see it like that. But I want to tell you guys some good 原因 why you should not see it like that. Why you guys should be looking at joining a 军团, to get the most out of your 3D坦克经验值.</p><p>Let's get the really, really, obvious one out of the way first as to why you should join a 军团? So that you can have 3D坦克好友 who 帮助 you in 战斗, of course. I mean, 95% of people who join a 军团 join it for this 原因, and those who do not join a 军团 still want people who 帮助 them in 战斗. After all, you know those 战斗 that are closely-matched? The ones you really want are someone who you can rely upon to 帮助 you? Would it not be so much better to have 3D坦克好友 you can rely on to 帮助 you in those 战斗?</p><p>Again, a pretty obvious one. In ordinary 3D坦克战斗, you learn 上将能力. But those 能力 can only take you so far, and there are certainly 其他 people out there with more 能力 than you. If you join a 军团, you can get taught by these "experts" to learn their 能力. It's a lot harder to learn 能力 from 其他 when you barely know them! Also, when it comes down to 军团战斗, there are a lot of things that can be learned that you cannot learn in an ordinary 战斗. These things can normally only be taught by someone with 经验值: 能力 that can only be learned in a 军团. Learning from more experienced and more skilled 坦克手 is another great 原因 to be in a 军团.</p><p>Believe it or not, being in a 军团 gives you more 水晶. There are obvious ways: 军团锦标赛, which your 军团 can take part in and potentially win, the ability to win more 水晶 with your 军团 helping you, 军团 letting you get the 金箱子 if you have a weaker 车库, and so on. But most 军团 also often have that one really rich person who can 购买水晶 for 其他军团 members... and who knows, that 其他军团 member that they 购买 for might be you next time!</p><p>I have to admit, 跑酷 is one aspect of 3D坦克 that never really caught my fancy. Maybe it was because I have never been good at it, or whether I simply find it boring, but I simply do not enjoy it. Even so, most 坦克手 do. 跑酷 is one of the most popular non-playing aspects of 3D坦克, and one of the things that many 坦克手 enjoy doing in 3D坦克 to 通行证 the time. And how better to do 跑酷 than with a 小组 of 坦克手 from one 军团 all working together?</p><p>Simply put, being in a 军团 means you have more people with whom you can work in any normal 3D坦克战斗. And for most people, working together in any game is always more enjoyable, especially when it normally results in a 胜利. With a 军团, you could do that far more often – after all, teamwork in a game is what a 军团 is all about!</p><p>Some people do not enjoy having 好友 over the Internet, but I, for one, think that making 好友 over the Internet is a great thing to do. A 军团, in any 在线 game, can be an amazingly great way to make 好友 with people who enjoy the same 在线 game as you do. So many people have made great 好友在线, many of whom have been part of a 军团 in any of the numerous 在线 games. You could make 好友, too, in a 军团! Why not a 3D坦克军团, if you really enjoy the game?</p><p>Also, have you ever wanted to talk about 3D坦克 with people? If so, join a 军团! Conversations in a 军团聊天 are generally more helpful than 服务器聊天 conversations, by the way. So, of course, don't think of the average 等级 of conversation in the 服务器聊天 and translate it into what it would be like in a 军团.</p><p>So there you go. So far, I've given seven 原因 to be in a 军团. But yet, some of you are probably still not convinced. You guys probably realize that everything I've said so far can be done with a 小组 of 坦克手 who like to 聊天 together. After all, you hardly need to be a 军团 to work together in a 战斗, of course. You could form a 3D坦克 Skype 聊天 instead, or a 小组 of people on a 3D坦克论坛, or a TeamSpeak 服务器, or whatever strikes your fancy.</p><p>But why, I say, be a 小组 and not be a 军团? What are the advantages of solely being based on a Skype 聊天? There is no difference between being a 小组 of 坦克手 and a 军团, except for the inability to fight official 军团战争 and take part in 军团锦标赛. So why not be a 军团 as well, if you are part of a 小组 of 坦克手 regularly contacting each 其他 and fighting together? You may as well create a topic on the 论坛 and act as a 军团. There are also numerous advantages of being a 军团, which a 3D坦克 club or 小组 cannot bring. These are:</p><p>军团战争 are always a good learning 经验值. And how can you play in official 战争, where gameplay is the most intense, if you are not in a 军团? 军团战争 are a 3D坦克经验值 not to be missed, especially when they are official and have lots of pride at stake. Only official 军团 can take part in such 战争.</p><p>Why not? 军团锦标赛 are great fun to compete in with your 3D坦克好友, such as the Hexathlon and similar 锦标赛. Competing in a 军团 tournament or working together to win a 军团 contest is a really good 原因 for joining a 军团, and one that can bring out the best in 3D坦克. If you are passionate about 3D坦克, what is better than winning things in a 团队 in the game you are so passionate about?
You never know about this one... some of the best 军团 have been given exclusive opportunities to test things for the new game. What 其他 goodies are the developers lining up only for the 军团 to test?</p><p>Even now, for an English 坦克手 like you, it isn't completely dominated by Russian 军团 by any means.  The 军团 All Kind became the first EN 军团 to win the Starladder Pro Series, hence allowing them to compete with the best Russian 军团.  eSports in the English Community are definitely rising.  What better time is there to join a 军团?</p><p>And there you have it. Ten 原因 why YOU should be in a 军团. Of course, all these 原因 are not universal, and people will be convinced by some and not 其他. And yes, I know that some people have very legitimate 原因 for not being in a 军团. But even so, there are many very good 原因 for joining a 军团, which I outlined above. Being in a 军团 is something very 特殊 in 3D坦克 and an opportunity, if you are an avid 3D坦克玩家, not to be missed.</p><div align="right"><small>Last Edit: Myojin 10/26/2025</small></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha512-v2CJ7UaYy4JwqLDIrZUI/4hqeoQieOmAZNXBeQyjo21dadnwR+8ZaIJVT8EE2iyI61OV8e6M8PP2/4hpQINQ/g==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
