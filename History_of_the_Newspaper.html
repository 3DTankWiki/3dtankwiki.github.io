</p><p>The English Newspaper had its start in late February of 2012, when Tommy60, the main 创建者 of the paper, found a well-known Russian Newspaper administrator, Les_Alterman, in a 疯狂思维空间互夺军旗战斗. After discussing the possibility and his willingness to start a newspaper in the game's second most popular 语言, Tommy made an article about how some 玩家 had come to find 3D坦克 over the past few years. He sent the article to Bruce Lunga, the English community manager of the time, who approved it and found assigned conanthedestroyer to the role of editor.  The two were joined by a now inactive 玩家, who went by the name of cablaz. A few weeks of collaborative planning, and a few days of writing later, and the first Newspaper was written, designed, and published, with contests and everything.</p><p>Strangely, if it really came down to it, the actual creation of Newspaper sprouted most probably from envy. Just a couple of glances from the members of the English Community at the Russians would see the activity of the Russian Newspaper and its popularity amongst the community. Of course, if you had asked them six months before when Bruce had barely started his immense work in the community, not many people would have seen a newspaper forthcoming. But, indeed, with the new community manager keen to get as much as he could started, the newspaper was quickly planned, and put into action.</p><p>The first issue of the Newspaper was a great hit. The avid readers of the community delved into some fantastic pieces of writing, including a couple of interesting interviews with two top English 玩家 of the time, Koolwalky and Contaminated. With a top-notch design from Les_Alterman covering the very first MT, the newspaper had well and truly begun.</p><p>Bruce soon realized the importance of getting a couple more writers involved. Four had too much brunt to carry. After a discussion in their Skype 聊天, the well-known faces of chriswu and Lhamster were suggested and unanimously voted in to join the 团队 of reporters. Chriswu immediately rose to one of the greatest reporters with some absolutely top-quality writings in his first two issues, including a couple of world-class stories such as his "Secret of the 失落神庙". The readers of the newspaper were becoming more and more impressed, with fondness in particular growing for Les's fantastic designs.</p><p>In case the newspaper was turning too much into a "弹匣", skitee decided to start up a 每周 update on the progress of the 3D坦克 World Cup, which was going on at the time. Some 其他 interactive 活动 started up including the Editorials and the well-received 军团 Logo Contest, which got almost all of the 军团 in the English Community involved - obviously bringing up the interest of the paper. Another contest of 史诗 proportions, the "Designer of 3D坦克", posted in Issue 4, brought in a staggering 高等级 of quality entries and was won by dimmmmy who came in to join the 3D坦克 Designer's 团队 for a very short time.</p><p>Soon, a major 活动 in the life of the Newspaper was to take place. Les_Alterman gradually passed the baton over from his early administrative role as he went back to work with the Russians and let Conan take over as boss; and it's stayed that way for the last couple of years. A fine designer, chris took over creating the Main Topic - and he did a mighty fine job of it too.</p><p>Another addition would be joining to seriously bolster content in a couple of issues, after cablaz had to quit his Reporter when he quit. An avid worker, Ranger7 would sometimes write nearly half of the articles in one issue - that's how much he wrote. In fact, the Reporter 团队 had to limit content published by each writer because he sometimes wrote so much that it was a bit of Ranger overkill!</p><p>A few of the more long-lasting series started off early including the popular "If The English Community was..." as well as the popular contest "What 地图?". Two issues later, with the readership growing and the newspaper's quantity of articles with it, Conan employed a couple more reporters. The proficient and detailed ShadowVisions and the... erm... yeah, hogree joined the 团队. Though I say it myself, it was a good time to be a reporter. The Newspaper was going on well, even with the hectic Rebalance occurring at the time. With skitee's consistent coverage of the 军团 continuing, featuring the 军团 Championship Final review, as well as the always-entertaining Predictions for 2013, articles were being produced well, and the atmosphere was great.</p><p>The next couple of months contained a couple of outstanding articles, with ShadowVisions' complete "Shopper's Guide to the Rebalance" giving the full 低-down on the post-rebalance 3D坦克 in style, and skitee's "地图 That Once Were" stealing the plaudits in Issue 9, giving a detailed and thoroughly enjoyable look at the 地图 of the ancient times! Meanwhile, new additions to the 团队 were popping up. already.dead who reported for a couple of issues, and a new superb designer, 雾-LIGHT stepped in to take over the Main Topic with chriswu's departure from the 团队. Along with them came another new reporter, suggested by ShadowVisions, the hard-working loktinho.</p><p>The next month or so was slightly more eventful for the 团队. Firstly, it was April. And for it, Lham decided to pull of an attempted April Fool's trick for the occasion. Claiming the English and Germany Communities were to close, and the Newspaper with it, it went surprisingly well, mainly because Bruce joined in with a "confirmation" message on the topic. On a less light-hearted note, Visi was taken quite seriously ill, and 传奇 reporter Skitee quit, and Tommy60 was temporarily removed due to real-life conflicts. With a sudden chronic lack of reporters, Conan put out a call for new reporters. He was certainly heard, and 5 new reporters were accepted into the 团队 the very next month.</p><p>These five reporters were the smart jokjinari, the always-entertaining GoldRock, the light-hearted character of SwagBoy11, the consistent Valletta, and the meticulous Selena12121, bringing a new dimension to the writing of the newspaper. They didn't take long to warm up with GoldRock producing one of the most humorous articles of all time in "The 10 Commandments of 3D坦克" among the entertaining works that the new Reporters would produce over the next few months.</p><p>Little would change in the next couple of months. Stand-out moments included the beginning of the series of "In the Beginning, 3D坦克" which would eventually become the longest series to date, the first "Ultimate Guide" - to 磁力炮 and the addition of Raphael2 as a writer for the French readers. Soon, he would become a famous English reporter who was known for always providing an entertaining article, no matter what. On top of this, Lhamster was "promoted" to a Designer's 职务 and took over doing the Main Topics after 雾-Light had to quit.</p><p>A number of well-known new faces were soon to bumper up the 团队 once again. After a few less welcome 活动 which culminated in GoldRock and Selena12121 being removed from the 团队 - at least, temporarily - the search for new reporters began again and 5 new faces of differing influence were added. The five new ones, this time, were the artistic ArchangeI, the diligent Vikingsrall, the humorous Fjelstad1678, the helpful hithere1, and the receptive aojsd. Each would take on different degrees of roles in the 未来世界 of the Newspaper, with Vikingsrall's interviews, Fjelstad's stories and ArchangeI's creations catching the eye in particular.</p><p>It was around this time that the Arabic newspaper started as well, with MisterGeneral and 6B6B (now JL6H) taking main responsibility for the running of Arabic articles for the vast Arabic playerbase. There were more stand-out articles as both sets of new reporters settled in in different degrees. Especially eye-catching were Valletta's last episode of "The 危机", which got great feedback, hogree's "Mastering the 3D坦克键盘" detailing different set of available 键盘控制 for 玩家, and the ending of Jokjinari's long series detailing the life of a young boy who got involved with the 3D坦克 developers in real life!</p><p>It was now March 2014. The Newspaper was moving along nicely, but a change was set to happen. As a test, 3D坦克 moved the newspaper onto the homepage, and Monthly issues ended. The articles would be published separately at any time and posted on the front page. It was risky - a risk that didn't pay off. Although some great articles were published on the front page, such as the returned GoldRock's detailed guide on 经验值战斗 and hogree's guide on the same subject. But there were just not enough articles, and to say it didn't succeed is an understatement.</p><p>Thankfully, the newspaper moved back to the Press 论坛 to happy faces in June on one of its most well-viewed issues. Soon after came the 公告 of four new reporters to 帮助 move it back along. After many applications were sent through for the job, the four chosen were the extremely experienced MadDog21, the "turns-out-he-was-a-good-cherry" (inside joke) kirby2008, the 跑酷-mad williew and the procrastinator Fen-Harel. Nonetheless, he is still a good writer. :P Along with these four came along the face of MrAngel (now Law-Enforcer) to 帮助 with the Arabic newspaper.</p><p>The next few months were golden months for the newspaper. With possibly one of the most successful series of all time in the newspaper, Kirby's Comparison Series beginning, along with GoldRock's "What to Mount on" Series and the always-funny "The 独裁者" - it meant that the readers were definitely not going to be let down with the articles!</p><p>Three more reporters would be added soon to keep the fresh writing coming in - the precise Remaine, the sprightly Kevred, and the knowledgeable Thekillerpenguin adding to the bunch of reporters writing. And so, the newspaper continues on. Conan's still here, Lham's still here, we're all still here - and we'll try to be here producing entertaining and useful articles for as long as we can!</p><p>Amateur Writing was introduced in 2015/2016</p><p>In Fall of 2018: The Newspaper introduced Guest Writers, some shining stars that had performed particularly well in writing endeavors such as writing contests, including the mega contest "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.tankiforum.com/topic/372410-write-for-the-tanki-newspaper-contest/">Write for the 3D坦克 Newspaper</a>", introduced<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.tankiforum.com/index.php?showtopic=377080">here</a>as well as a Tankiverse lore mastermind in Hippin_in_Hawaii.</p><p>Between Jan - Feb 2019: The Newspaper grew dormant and teased some large changes coming to the Newspaper. Such changes were announced in 2019 January on the<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.tankiforum.com/topic/379338-big-changes-coming-to-the-newspaper-this-february/">论坛 topic</a>and<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfR3YoLpQVM">视频周报 202</a>, which included the prioritization of 普通每周 articles over 特殊 and newspaper issues. At this time, unfortunately, the Newspaper shut down 其他语言 Newspapers.</p><p>In March through the Summer of 2019: Was a lot quieter - the Newspaper released two hot contests, the Ultimate Guide Maker and the 每周 Question series, but after that, it was much quieter. If I recall correctly, Vikingsrallentando left sometime during the summer, and then Hex himself became administrator alongside Flexoo</p><p>Between Summer - Winter 2019: Following that time, some rising stars from the AWS (no self plugging intended) Tidebreaker, pythor20000 (Pythor), and Person_Random, gradually joined the 等级 of the reporters during the course of that time.  This new blood led to a revival for the Newspaper, allowing them to create a Halloween and NY 2020 Issue. Towards the end of the year, Hex retired, allowing kaisdf to step up as administrator.</p><p>During Jan - March 2020: The Newspaper was up on the rise once again - despite Flexoo's departure early in the year, the 团队 gained a productive and innovative reporter in Sacrifice and re-introduced the French Newspaper, a fresh perspective and thriving paper run by reporter 老兵 Regency.</p><p>Between April - Summer 2020: With the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, the Newspaper hit a huge rise in productivity - the 团队 of young blood pumped out article after article, change after change, which culminated in a 特殊 issue right in time to celebrate 3D坦克's 11th birthday.</p><p>From Fall to Winter 2020: The Newspaper continued to ride on this strong 潮汐 of momentum brought by the pandemic, bringing together a Halloween and New Years' issue.</p><p>In 2021: The new year brought a new face to the leadership of the Newspaper, Person_Random, as well as two new reporters - Venerable for the EN squad as well as the French Reporter brother_of_pro.</p><p>As of today in Spring 2021: With Random's innovation as well as a creative 队长 in the new French Newspaper manager, Dynasty, the Newspaper presented a collaboration with the Contests 团队, the Competitor initiative, in March. The following month, they built upon the early success with a  humorous Fool's issue. With new blood strengthening the 团队 and tons of projects and 其他 endeavors in construction, the Newspaper will continue to innovate and bring entertaining articles hot off the press!</p><p>Unfortunately today, the Newspaper has been discontinued. No new issues are being written, but 玩家 can still read archives and old issues.</p><div align="right"><small>Last Edit: HelpersBot 5/21/2024</small></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha512-v2CJ7UaYy4JwqLDIrZUI/4hqeoQieOmAZNXBeQyjo21dadnwR+8ZaIJVT8EE2iyI61OV8e6M8PP2/4hpQINQ/g==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
