</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h3><p>What better way to continue our journey through the game 模式 than 互夺军旗, or 互夺军旗. By far the most commonly played game 模式, 互夺军旗 arguably requires the widest set of 能力 of all the 模式. Simply killing and suppressing the 红队 is not enough - you can have a death-loss ratio of 100 and it still means nothing unless you capture 旗子!</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Scoring">Scoring</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Flag_Interactions">旗子 Interactions</span></h4><p>Since 旗子 are at the centre of this 模式, it makes sense for 旗子 capturing and returning to be worth the most points. It's much harder to wait for the perfect moment (timing is 钥匙) to infiltrate the enemy base, make it out alive and carry it back home with all the enemy's sights trained on you, than to simply take out an enemy 坦克. And thus, capturing a 旗子 is worth points equivalent to ten times the number of active 玩家 on the enemy 团队. So, if the 红队 number six active 玩家, one solo capture will be worth sixty points. Of course, enemy 旗子 can go on quite a detour before reaching your own base and being cashed in for the point and 分数. They can be passed from 玩家 to 玩家 directly, or if the carrier is destroyed, the 旗子 can be quickly picked up by another 团队 member. Capturing the 旗子 generally gives you the most points, but the amount you get depends somewhat on the distance travelled too. Because of this, it makes a lot of sense to back up the 旗子-bearer. If they are killed, or are weak, you can be ready to take the baton immediately and keep it moving towards a capture as fast as possible.</p><p>If the enemy 旗子 is returned, all is reset. That is to say all the 旗子-holding that you've done has gone to waste and none of those 玩家 will get any points!</p><p>Returning a 旗子 also gains you points - and it depends on how far the 旗子 is from your base. Returning a 旗子 that's right next to your base will give you just a measly point.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Destroying_Tanks">Destroying 坦克</span></h4><p>Destroying 红队 gives you points of course, as it does in any game-模式. But, recently, the scoring mechanics for kills changed, significantly in fact. Whereas before it was the 坦克 that finished the enemy off that took all the points, now 15 points are shared between all 团队 members that did 伤害 to that 坦克. This means you shouldn't wait for the kill steal - fire straight away!</p><p>Destroying an enemy 旗子-bearer gives you extra points, so 普通 sense would tell you to aim at that 坦克! This is usually the case anyway, unless there is a 治疗磁力炮 that needs to be taken care of before.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Healing">治疗</span></h4><p>The only 其他 way of gaining points, 其他 than the above, is 治疗 with 磁力炮. The amount of points you gain is proportional to the actual amount of 伤害 healed - you won't benefit by 治疗 the weakest 底盘 first, heal the 坦克 that need to health immediately.</p><p>This also conveniently brings me to my argument that 磁力炮 are a necessity of any good 互夺军旗团队. They can heal and support raiders of the enemy base, giving them the ability to withstand heavier fire, back up the heavy armour that is pounding away at the enemy 职务, repair 守卫者 after an enemy onslaught, as well as restoring the health of holders of the enemy 旗子 in a so called '旗子 stand-off'. This is where both 团队 have each 其他's 旗子 safe and secure behind their own lines, and the race is to see who can return their own 旗子 first.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Offence">Offence</span></h3><p>There are various roles you can take up within a 互夺军旗团队, and one of the most important is offence. Without attacking aggressively and trying for the enemy 旗子, how can you expect to win?</p><p>So, now you've decided you want to attack, but what combination is best? Sure, any combination can be used to capture a 旗子, but there are definitely some that are better than 其他 in the particular situation at hand, the primary factor being the 地图.</p><p>On very small 地图, such as 小岛, it might be acceptable to use a heavy 坦克 such as 猛犸象 or 泰坦, since the distance that needs to be run is not so great. But on larger 地图 like the commonly played 寂静, a big fortress like 猛犸象 probably isn't what you want. Don't forget - the aim is not to kill the most and die the least, you can die as many times as you need and it won't matter. The aim is to capture 旗子. As a 猛犸象 user, it will take a long, long time to even reach the enemy base, meaning that over a period of time, you will have less attempts to try and steal a 旗子. And even when you make it in, the amount of time it takes to get you out leaves you open to a lot of enemy fire. In this sense, 速度 can make up for lack of health - it means you are being shot at for a shorter length of time!</p><p>So, on medium 地图 like these, a medium 底盘 would be, in my opinion at least, the ideal choice - they are the perfect balance of 速度 and health. In larger 地图 like 大桥3C, or 古代城堡, 速度 is even more important than before. Here, perhaps a lighter 底盘 such as 蜂王 or even 黄蜂轻甲 could be best suited for the job.</p><p>I believe the strongest part of a successful 旗子 raid is down to the 底盘, but the 炮塔 is important too. Again, the ideal choice depends a lot on the 地图. But let's look at each of the weapon classes one by one.</p><p>First, short 射程. That includes 火焰炮, 黄蜂轻甲 and 磁力炮. Short 射程 weapons are ideal on small 地图, where the 其他 weapons won't be able to use their 射程 advantage as successfully, and you can hunt them down much more easily. But, interestingly, short 射程 weapons can also be great on large 地图 too. A 黄蜂轻甲-冰风暴 can quite easily invade enemy lines, lay some of the 红队 out of action, and escape quickly and nimbly. I place this down to the fact that part of 旗子-capturing involves entering the enemy base - that is to say you are forced to move into close proximity with the enemy, no matter what 地图 it is. Looking at it in this way, maybe 冰风暴 or 火焰炮 on 大桥3C doesn't look so bad after all.</p><p>Secondly, the medium 射程炮塔 that are 离子炮 and 火龙珠. As mentioned above, their relatively limited 射程 isn't too much of a compromise when going for 旗子, even on large 地图. Though they are probably best suited to small-medium 射程地图.</p><p>Lastly, the long 射程炮塔. 雷暴炮 first of all, I would avoid using for offence unless the 地图 is large. This is because, when snatching the 旗子, you cannot make full use of its impressive 射程, and you are vulnerable to self 伤害 -an enemy presses against you and you can't 射击 him without hurting yourself! In small-medium 地图, I would nearly always prefer 轰天炮 over 雷暴炮 in offence - it is a much cleaner 炮塔. 激光炮 should also be reserved for the large 地图. Sure, it packs a deadly punch, and you might be able to take out one, two or even three with one shot. But what about the rest? How will you fend them off? 镭射炮, I think should be avoided in all scenarios. You cannot unleash 镭射炮's mighty 狙击模式 while moving, so why would you choose 镭射炮 when you can pick, say 轰天炮?</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Defence">Defence</span></h3><p>As well as a good attacking force, a good 互夺军旗团队 also needs an on-the-lookout defensive 团队 to make sure the enemy attackers do not steal your own 旗子.</p><p>In 上将, since 守卫者 will spend a lot of their time in and around their own base, 速度 is not as important. Therefore, in 上将, heavier 底盘 are preferred over lighter 底盘, since their large amount of health outweighs their lack of 速度. Furthermore, the heavy 坦克 are...heavy! And this means it is harder for 红队 to push you away - you can sit on the 旗子 and they will have a hard time pushing you off it!</p><p>Slightly lighter 底盘 such as 维京 can still be very usable in defence, and 允许 the 守卫者 to play more of a hybrid role in the 团队. When attacking, the 玩家 can move forward to support and carry the 团队 back to the base, and when defending, the 玩家 can quickly drop back to 帮助 shore up the defences there.</p><p>As regards to weapons, in 上将 there are two 钥匙 components of a good defensive 团队 - 冰风暴 and 磁力炮.</p><p>冰风暴 is one of the best defensive weapons in the game. Not so much for its 伤害, but for its ability, which fractions the enemy 速度 and prevents them from getting away fast, also allowing your own 团队 to place more 伤害 on that 玩家. It also has the ability to hit multiple targets, allowing you for example to slow down many attackers at the same time and take out the annoying 磁力炮 that is 治疗 the spearhead of the attack.</p><p>磁力炮 are great for their unique ability to heal your own 团队. They can boost the health of 守卫者 during an 突袭, making it harder for attackers to take out your defence, and they can restore the health of your 团队 between 突袭, ensuring that your defence is ready for the next one.</p><p>Bear note that these are 上将 guidelines. For example, on 运动场 a defending 团队 sat around the 旗子 would be easy pickings for the enemy.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Midfield">Midfield</span></h3><p>Halfway in between the attacking and defending forces, controlling the 宇宙 that connects the two, are the 坦克 that 控制 the heart of the 地图, that facilitate the attackers and picking off 红队 that make it out of your base alive.</p><p>Being at the centre of the game, you are likely to be exposed, and this means that lighter 底盘 probably aren't so good in these 职务, except on particularly large 地图. But, on the flipside, a 坦克 too heavy doesn't give you the 速度 to play the varied nature of this role, and it makes it harder for you to move from supporting one area of the game to another. Thus, I believe the medium 底盘 like 猎人中甲 and 维京 are perfect to fulfil this role.</p><p>Being exposed, 镭射炮 probably isn't the best choices here. Short 射程 weapons can be great on the small 地图, but in larger 地图 they are just prone to enemy fire. Longer 射程 weapons such as 轰天炮 or 雷暴炮 can be great on medium 射程地图, and for the very large ones, 激光炮 could work too.</p><div align="right"><small>Last Edit: HelpersBot 5/21/2024</small></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha512-v2CJ7UaYy4JwqLDIrZUI/4hqeoQieOmAZNXBeQyjo21dadnwR+8ZaIJVT8EE2iyI61OV8e6M8PP2/4hpQINQ/g==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
