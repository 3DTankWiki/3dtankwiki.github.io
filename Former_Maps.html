</div><p>We have a large number of 地图 at our disposal, but not all of them have been in the game thus far. Here's a list of all of them, with their descriptions, plus a preview of the 地图.<br><br>
</p><h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Former_Maps">Former 地图</span></h1><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deck-9">甲板9号</span></h3><p><span typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/0/01/Deck9.jpg/200px-Deck9.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="100" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/0/01/Deck9.jpg/300px-Deck9.jpg 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/0/01/Deck9.jpg/400px-Deck9.jpg 2x"></span></span> <br>
</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>It was removed due to the 地图's inactivity - it wasn't being played often enough.<br>
<b>More info:</b>甲板9号; a small 地图 - one that was only able to fit 4 玩家. Created by M0ONL1ght, the very person who created 铁塔 and 峡谷, it was a very fun 地图 to play in. Each side had its own advantages, but none were powerful to the extent that you could predict which side was going to win; and that's something a good 地图 has - prior to the 地图 update, you had to be a 准将 to play it; this was before the 地图 update way back in 2012, which saw this increase to 准将 from 特级准尉, which was definitely something that lowered its overall popularity; even before that update, 一等兵 were able to try their hand at this awesome 地图. It was added to the game on June 4th, 2010. It consisted of two tunnels, which once accessed, lead you to a 旗子, along with an outside part, which was the 职务 of the 其他旗子. It also had two ramps that were used by 守卫者. It was popular for 4 versus 4 drug 战争 in 2012. The elder 甲板9号 had a small route in the middle which enabled one to swipe the 旗子 sneakily and run. In the more modern 甲板9号, a 普通 way of escaping was via going UNDER the ramp (yes, that was possible) - unfortunately, you could sometimes find yourself getting stuck within the barrels, despite using a light 底盘.<br>

</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>It was removed since the testing of the new props ended.<br>
<b>More info:</b>A big 地图; it was added to the game for the purpose of testing new props namely "lll-set propyl" which is a new set of props that are to be used for 未来世界地图. Added on the Christmas Eve of 2012, it wasn't really made for any game 模式 - more a 格式 called 跑酷. The plentiful amount of buildings provided a variety of tasks for 坦克手们 and their 好友. It reminded me of a more modern 古代城堡 - when you first played it, you weren't really able to find your way through with ease. It didn't have any 水晶 or 道具 drops - if you wanted to have an advantage in 战斗, you had to use your own. You needed to be a 军士长 to 帮助 out in the testing.<br>
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Silence_II">寂静 II</span></h3><p><span typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/7/79/Silence2.png/200px-Silence2.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="134" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/7/79/Silence2.png 1.5x"></span></span> <br>
</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>The merge - the features of both 寂静 and 寂静 II were looked at and were put in/removed, to make the one 地图, which was somewhat closer to the 寂静 you see today.<br>
<b>More info:</b>It looks somewhat like the 寂静 we see today, no? The discernible difference, of course, being the fence that blocked a great escape route for the red side, which meant that whilst it was around, it required more bulk as opposed to swiftness when escaping. Not only this, you may have noticed that some of the tunnels are non-existent, the ramp at the left side is a lot more narrow, which meant for more sabotage, hence not so commonly used at the time - the ramp at the center of the 地图 wasn't there either, so it was like a sniper spot for the 守卫者, although easily exposed. It's somewhat agreed that in the current 寂静, the red side will generally win due to the infrastructure of the 地图 - it's not quite the same in this case. Due to the advantages of losing their presence here, the blue side had more of a 几率 of taking the win. Unless you're escaping from the blue base, gameplay pretty much felt the same, and the differences here and there didn't have much impact. It's always been a 10-10 although, on one occasion, a developer decided to create a 寂静 II 战斗 that had 20 玩家 - it must've been a pain to capture a 旗子 in such circumstances!<br>

</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>It was replaced by a current 地图 in the game namely 摩天大楼 on June 3, 2014.<br>
<b>More info:</b>A large spacious 地图 with very little cramped quarters. Prior to the 地图 update, you needed to be a 中尉 to play it. It was large but easy to navigate through. The pathways were also very narrow which meant that when on them, 炮塔 with strong 冲击力 were able to push 玩家关闭, depending on how they went about shooting. It was quite a trek in regards to capturing each 旗子 - you had to do a lot and get through a lot in order to capture a 旗子. Another thing people liked a lot about it is the somewhat easily accessible room Abyss had.<br>
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Moon_Silence">Moon 寂静</span></h3><p><span typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/b/b5/Moonsilence.png/200px-Moonsilence.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="108" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/b/b5/Moonsilence.png/300px-Moonsilence.png 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/b/b5/Moonsilence.png/400px-Moonsilence.png 2x"></span></span> <br>
</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>Hackers. They were too much of a deterrent and it ruined gameplay.<br>
<b>More info:</b>Another variation of 寂静? How fun! On the Cosmonauts Day of 2013, Moon 寂静 was added to the game. What made it different from the current 寂静 at the time? NOTHING, when you exclude the lack of 铁塔, the 宇宙-like 声音, and a different skybox. The feel of weightlessness was made more abundant in this 地图, and that's what everyone liked. The thing is, the 地图's temporary permanence wasn't always meant to be. The developers had a 'let's-see-how-it-goes' attitude when releasing this 地图. Depending on its popularity, the 地图 would either be removed after a short period, or it would stay. As expected, the 玩家 welcomed the 地图 with open arms, which lead to it permanently staying. Not only this, it was available for every 等级!<br>
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Platform">Platform</span></h3><p><span typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/7/7d/Platform.png/200px-Platform.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="89" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/7/7d/Platform.png/300px-Platform.png 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/7/7d/Platform.png/400px-Platform.png 2x"></span></span> <br>
</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>The 创建者 requested it to be removed.<br>
<b>More info:</b>Not here for very long; a 地图 that slightly ascended in the 玩家 amount the time it was here. It went from being a 6-6 to a 8-8. It was added on July 19 of 2013, as a result of the 创建者 being a winner of the "Looking for a new 等级 designer" contest. He didn't win the grand prize but placed well. He is a 大元帅 named tank789. According to him, the plan was for it to be called "Unreal" before being changed to Platform - a change for the better if anything. The gameplay was particularly great in 死亡混战 and 互夺军旗, and much less so for 团队对战.<br>
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Canyon">峡谷</span></h3><p><span typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/3/3d/Canyon.png/200px-Canyon.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="127" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/3/3d/Canyon.png/300px-Canyon.png 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/3/3d/Canyon.png/400px-Canyon.png 2x"></span></span> <br>
</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>It was removed due to the 地图's inactivity.<br>
<b>More info:</b>Another good 地图 by M0ONL1ght gone? The horror! Added on the very same day as 甲板9号, 峡谷 was somewhat well known for the great ramp it had - when hit by a few 激光炮 in the correct direction, the number of flips you became capable of doing was impressive. As for its gameplay, you could either ascend through cramped tunnels or via spacious 沙漠 pathways - the latter option being quicker, as expected, although the cramped tunnels made for better means of escapade. Given that it's rather small, it catered to all kinds of 炮塔, and I guess that's one of the 原因 why people were a fan of it. It was one of the 地图 where it wasn't too difficult to utilize any combo effectively, no matter how unorthodox. The hole in there could be seen as a hindrance. If you wanted a 峡谷 game, it didn't take too long to find one.<br>

</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>It was removed due to the 地图's inactivity.<br>
<b>More info:</b>Not the biggest of 地图 at all. One of its stand-out features was the four entrance center that it had. If you asked a set of 玩家 if they've heard of the 地图 before, many a time would you hear the answer "No" - unfortunately, it was pretty unpopular.<br>

</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>It was removed since the testing of the new props was over.<br>
<b>More info:</b>Gallery - another 地图 that was there for the purpose of testing out the new props, except it wasn't played so much for 跑酷 - more for 团队对战 and 互夺军旗. With good balance, you were capable of reaching new heights, given it was possible to move on some of the arches on the 地图. This 地图, in particular, also looked very nice in appearance - fair to say it was the more played of the two, given that it's easier to navigate around the 地图; gameplay could actually flow.<br>
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Carousel">Carousel</span></h3><p><span typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/7/7a/Carousel.png/200px-Carousel.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="116" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/7/7a/Carousel.png/300px-Carousel.png 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/7/7a/Carousel.png/400px-Carousel.png 2x"></span></span> <br>
</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>The race 活动 was over.<br>
<b>More info:</b>Carousel was a very unique 地图. It was specially created for a 特殊活动, namely, a 3D坦克 race, which was held in March 2011 and won by “nikita544”. Carousel was only made in 死亡混战模式 and contained up to eleven 玩家. As you can see from the video, there is a central platform where the 激光炮 “referee” is standing on. You cannot see this fact in the video, but that area is where all the 玩家 respawned, which gave an advantage to 玩家 using weapons such as 火焰炮 or 冰风暴 as all the 玩家 who respawned were within their 射程. However, you will also be able to see the “outer rim”, where the race occurred. No respawning occurred there, but 玩家 using 激光炮, 轰天炮, or 雷暴炮 (镭射炮 did not exist when Carousel was around) were able to “escape” to the edges and snipe from there at the 其他玩家, out of 射程 of all except fellow long-射程 weapons.<br>
</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fly_Test">Fly Test</span></h3><p><span typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/c/cc/FlyTest_Preview.png/250px-FlyTest_Preview.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="250" height="105" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/c/cc/FlyTest_Preview.png/375px-FlyTest_Preview.png 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/c/cc/FlyTest_Preview.png/500px-FlyTest_Preview.png 2x"></span></span> <br>
</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>The testing was finished.<br>
<b>More info:</b>Fly Test is a test 服务器特殊 and was for a very long time. Whenever you went into the Test 服务器, Fly Test was the 地图 which you would have to play in to 等级 up to 二等兵 before you could use addscore, which was the way the test 服务器 worked for a long time. (You couldn't use the 聊天 until you reached the 等级 of 二等兵, so it was a hard task for you to use your m0 轰天炮 m0 黄蜂轻甲 against these drugging M3-M3s...) New 玩家 will never be able to remember those 经验值. Do you think playing 3D坦克 is tough as it is? Not until you've experienced doing that, it isn't anywhere near tough. However, the actual purpose of this 地图 was not to 等级 up but to check the “Flying” ability of the 底盘. The 地图 had a whole series of towers at different heights where you could drive 关闭 and “fly” 关闭 and see how far you got. When the new 坦克 such as 蜂王 and 维京 were created, they were originally tested in Fly Test to see how far they would fly. The actual 地图 itself had no cover whatsoever (except for those ramps and “fly” jumps). No walls, no platforms, not even bushes. There was just a large open 宇宙 dispersed with these ramps and jumps.<br>

</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>It was unable to work in the main 服务器, with 玩家 reporting the 普通 “grey screen” problem when entering the 地图.<br>
<b>More info:</b>It was in the test 服务器 for a while and was released to the main 服务器 in September 2011. The layout is quite simple – yet very confusing! All the 地图 was spread out on one layer, but that layer was a maze – a “labyrinth”. One 团队 had their base on one side of the 地图, and the 其他团队 was on the 其他 side. But in the middle... chaos! Who knows? Okay, it was quite simple to work out once you got the hang of it. Even so, it wasn't easy! 火龙珠 was very useful in the 地图, but you had to guess the location of your 红队. 地雷 were also particularly useful, especially as the only way for 玩家 to avoid a 地雷 would be to change direction.<br>

</p><p><b>原因 for removal:</b>The celebrations were over.<br>
<b>More info:</b>This 地图 was released on December the 1st 2011 in commemoration of the 高 standing which 3D坦克 got in the “Runet Awards”. It had twice the number of 水晶箱子 drops than the average 地图 its 大小, which made it very popular for a time. It was a simple 地图, with the two 团队' bases on opposite sides of the 地图. There was a line of train tracks outside each base, a “platform” in the centre, and 路桥大战 leading over the platforms from each base. It was very simple and very popular for a time.<br>

</p><p><b>原因 for removal&nbsp;:</b>3D坦克 2.0 got cancelled.<br>
<b>More info:</b>Remember 3D坦克 2.0? Originally planned for August 2010, eventually canceled in May 2012? For a while, it appeared that it looked likely to happen. The original release date was going to be June the 4th 2011, and when a 2.0 test 服务器 was released a month before that date, it looked positive. The only problem was, the test 服务器 was not what people had been hoping for. It lagged, being way over-crowded, incredibly. The 车库 consisted of only a few weapons – 轰天炮, 雷暴炮, 火焰炮, and 激光炮, if I remember rightly, and a similarly small amount of 底盘 – 维京 was one, 黄蜂轻甲 as well – I think there may have been one more. There were only two 地图, Crash and 竞技场. The 图形 were scintillating. Absolutely brilliant. Gameplay? Meh. When everyone's lagging, it's not worth the bother. The big change which v2.tankionline.com had, however, was the interface. 玩家 had their own 简介, the 战斗大厅 could be searched, the whole layout was absolutely different from what we know today. It was absolutely incredible to 经验值, even if playing on the 服务器 was a pain, not to mention impossible.</p><h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Holiday_Maps">Holiday 地图</span></h1><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Halloween_2010_2">Halloween 2010</span></h2><figure typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><span><img resource="/File:Hallo2010flag.jpg" src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/3/37/Hallo2010flag.jpg/150px-Hallo2010flag.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="150" height="140" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/3/37/Hallo2010flag.jpg/225px-Hallo2010flag.jpg 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/3/37/Hallo2010flag.jpg/300px-Hallo2010flag.jpg 2x"></span><a href="https://en.tankiwiki.com/File:Hallo2010flag.jpg" class="mw-file-magnify"></a><figcaption>Appearance of the 旗子 during Halloween in 2010</figcaption></figure><p>Halloween in 2010 was rather basic, considering it was the first time 3D坦克 ever formally celebrated Halloween.

Some 其他特殊 decorations included a Christmas tree, a festive<a href="./Skyboxes" title="天空盒">Skybox</a>(the New Year one), and 特殊 sectors with falling 箱子 with 2 水晶 inside, around the Christmas tree. 3D坦克 also made a 特殊 holiday video dedicated to the 玩家 to celebrate this New Year of 2012!

The prototype looked something like this:</p><figure class="mw-halign-center" typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/6/63/NY2011_snowman.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="253" class="mw-file-element"></span><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the 南瓜炮塔, this 炮塔’s 机械师 was the same as that of modern-day<a href="./Smoky" title="轰天炮">轰天炮</a>’s.</p><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Map_Review_2">地图 Review</span></h3><p>This 地图 was pretty much modern-day 高地角斗场. The 地图 contained a platform and cliffs around it. At the center of the 地图, there was a big Christmas Tree and 水晶箱子 falling around it. It has a simple layout and the gameplay was simple. Due to the old physics and 机械师, you could practically “drift” on the 地图, somewhat similar to the skid that 蜂王 used to have when turning corners. The 地图 didn’t have many barriers - it was practically floating in mid-air. Due to the lack of barriers and drift, flipping over was easy and annoying, especially due to the old 10-second self-destruct time. The 玩家 enjoyed this 地图 a lot, especially due to the number of 水晶箱子 (which were relatively valuable back then) dropping near the Christmas Tree in the middle. This can be seen below:</p><figure class="mw-halign-center" typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/c/c1/NY2011-12_gameplay.jpg.jpg/400px-NY2011-12_gameplay.jpg.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="214" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/c/c1/NY2011-12_gameplay.jpg.jpg/600px-NY2011-12_gameplay.jpg.jpg 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/c/c1/NY2011-12_gameplay.jpg.jpg/800px-NY2011-12_gameplay.jpg.jpg 2x"></span><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Halloween_2012_2">Halloween 2012</span></h2><figure typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><span><img resource="/File:Goldhalloween2012.png" src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/0/0e/Goldhalloween2012.png/85px-Goldhalloween2012.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="85" height="86" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/0/0e/Goldhalloween2012.png/128px-Goldhalloween2012.png 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/0/0e/Goldhalloween2012.png/170px-Goldhalloween2012.png 2x"></span><a href="https://en.tankiwiki.com/File:Goldhalloween2012.png" class="mw-file-magnify"></a><figcaption>Appearance of the 金箱子 during the Halloween 2012 Festivities</figcaption></figure><p>This was the first time 3D坦克 had ever introduced a 地图 exclusively for Halloween. The Halloween celebrations started on October the 30th, 2012, and ended on November the 1st, 2012. There was a 特殊 Halloween 地图 with 金箱子 dropping on this 地图 with 305 水晶 in them. Additionally, there were festive<a href="./Paints" title="迷彩">迷彩</a>, decorated billboards, and unique 旗子 designed to decorate the 战斗 with their Halloween look. There was also a discount of 13%, exclusively for M3 炮塔 and 底盘.</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Map_Review_3">地图 Review</span></h4><p>In this 地图, you had to enable 动态阴影 to make the 地图 darker as opposed to now, where the 地图 is in a dark 主题 by default. This beautiful and spooky 地图 was a 中-sized 地图, which had a castle with a house in it. On the outside of the castle, there were cottages with trees, gravestones, 南瓜, and ghosts. The 地图 and the gameplay was similar to that of<a href="./Cologne" title="科隆">科隆</a>and<a href="./Fort_Knox" title="黑色城堡">黑色城堡</a>. In the middle, 金箱子 would fall occasionally, it was exceptionally valuable for that time, so many were just multing around the middle, killing each 其他 every so often, so it was fairly easy to snatch the enemy 旗子 by driving over the top of the 'castle'. You had plenty of nice camping spots and the dark part behind the 旗子 was a great camouflage spot because it was so dark. It was easy to flip on the ramps, you could hit the mults in the middle from up by rocking your 坦克 and shooting just at the right time. It was also very easy to make kills in the middle because of all the people who were just sitting in the middle waiting for a gold to fall. Back then, there were no Gold sirens nor notifications, the 金箱子 would simply fall on its own. These 玩家 would just stand in the middle moving their 炮塔 left and right (almost like they were shaking their head), or they would run around the middle house to try and hide from you. This 地图 was finally removed when the celebrations concluded on the 14th of November, 2012.</p><h2><span id="Happy_New_Year.21_2012.2F2013"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Happy_New_Year!_2012/2013">Happy New Year! 2012/2013</span></h2><div style="float:right;border:1px solid #bbb">

The Developers changed the whole game by adding the Rebalance Update on the 17th of December, 2012, followed by discounts on the 30th of December until the 2nd of January. There were different designs for all 箱子, 旗子, parachutes, and a 特殊 holiday 迷彩 with a Christmas 主题. Of course, there was also a 特殊-themed 地图 for the New Year!

The 地图 was extremely large, like a true racecourse! Unfortunately, the 地图 wasn’t exactly loved by most. Most people complained that the 地图 wasn’t great for racing nor gameplay purposes.
The 地图 was created to be like a racecourse, similar to that of 天空要塞 and 死亡轨道. The 地图 itself was divided into two parts for two 团队. Each 玩家 appeared in a small area with a few Nitro drop 箱子 in front of them. The 玩家 had to “race” to get to the top of the 地图. At the top, there was a big Christmas Tree, which was the only Capture Point in 控制点模式 and a few 道具箱子 around it. The road contained a few obstacles to make the racing more challenging, as can be seen below:</p><figure class="mw-halign-center" typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/2/23/HNY2014.15_racecourse.jpg/700px-HNY2014.15_racecourse.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="356" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/2/23/HNY2014.15_racecourse.jpg/1050px-HNY2014.15_racecourse.jpg 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/2/23/HNY2014.15_racecourse.jpg/1400px-HNY2014.15_racecourse.jpg 2x"></span><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>道具箱子 could be found on the roads, especially Nitros. The 玩家 didn’t enjoy the 地图 because it wasn’t designed to be for 战斗 purposes.

</p><p>The second was called<a href="./Eternity" title="永恒">Eternity</a>and was exclusively available to 坦克手们 in possession of a vip 账号.

</p><p>Halloween also came with its own 任务, where getting 3000 经验值 in the 地图 could be redeemed for a large 水晶 sum (which varied according to the 玩家’s 等级) in return. Additionally, the top 100 Gold 猎人中甲 during the Festivities were rewarded. The person who managed to capture the most 金箱子 was a 玩家 named<i>Ti-To</i>who managed to catch a staggering 195 金箱子!

The tombstones also added a whole new Gameplay element, they were bumpy, which was annoying but it meant that you had to be really aware of your surrounding. However, for the most part, people were playing only for the 金箱子, due to them dropping ten times the usual. The 地图 could only be played in 死亡混战模式, which made it somewhat boring but it also meant that there were no obligations attached - you did not have to worry about helping your 团队, you could focus all your attention towards catching as many 金箱子 as you could!

</p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Map_Review_10">地图 Review</span></h4><p>The addition of 突袭模式 was interesting, the 模式 had relatively good feedback. The 团队 you played for essentially guaranteed what your role was. The Red 团队 had to infiltrate the Blue base by delivering their Red 旗子 to the Blue 控制点. This meant that the Red 团队 played an attacking role and Blue played a defensive role, there was no ambiguity regarding your role. However, due to there being only one Red 旗子, everyone used to push each 其他 and sabotage in order to get in possession of the 旗子. This made it extremely difficult for attackers because teamwork was 暴击 but people were selfish and wanted the 旗子 for themselves. In order to win, you had to have very good teamwork. Defending the single 控制点 for Blue wasn’t overly difficult because everyone was ready for the attackers, however, the attackers had a hard time getting through Blue’s defense and actually capturing a 旗子. However, due to the certainty in roles, Gameplay became somewhat predictable - the Red 团队 had to attack in order to win and Blue had to defend in order to win. 金箱子 occasionally spiced up Gameplay but otherwise, attack strategies became predictable due to there not being very many routes to attack with.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Halloween_2016_2">Halloween 2016</span></h2><figure typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><span><img resource="/File:Goldhalloween2016.png" src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/e/ee/Goldhalloween2016.png/85px-Goldhalloween2016.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="85" height="82" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/e/ee/Goldhalloween2016.png/128px-Goldhalloween2016.png 1.5x, https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/e/ee/Goldhalloween2016.png/170px-Goldhalloween2016.png 2x"></span><a href="https://en.tankiwiki.com/File:Goldhalloween2016.png" class="mw-file-magnify"></a><figcaption>Appearance of the 金箱子 during the Halloween 2016 festivities</figcaption></figure><p>This year, 3D坦克 made the Halloween 地图 available for a whole 8 days, starting on Monday the 24th of October till Tuesday, the 1st of November.</p><figure typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><span><img resource="/File:Candies.png" src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/d/df/Candies.png/120px-Candies.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="120" height="77" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/d/df/Candies.png 1.5x"></span><a href="https://en.tankiwiki.com/File:Candies.png" class="mw-file-magnify"></a><figcaption>The 礼物 “Candies” was purchasable during the Halloween festivities for 2,000 水晶</figcaption></figure><p>There were specially themed decorations, such as billboards, bushes, trees, a 箱子 of candies as a 特殊 in-game 礼物 (more information about it<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="./Gifts">here</a>) and a 南瓜金箱子.

One of the 少校 changes was the fact that two large 路桥大战 were added. Both the bases were in a sort of a pit. The 山岗 located at the top of the 地图 made a great vantage point, which made a handy camping area. The cemetery was often not overly crowded due to the fact that you were completely exposed there. Most people preferred taking the “scenic route” which was more covered. One of the 路桥大战 led to the Blue base and made a decent getaway route but once again, it was rather unsheltered, meaning that you could quite easily be killed trying to run away with the 旗子. The 其他 bridge led to the highest 山岗. One of the most interesting things that happened during Halloween, was an 活动 featuring the almighty Godmode_ON! There was a 特殊活动 organized, called<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.tankiforum.com/index.php?showtopic=339578">“Running King”</a>, where the objective was to kill Godmode_ON.

Acting upon the critique of the previous 地图, the Developers changed up the 地图机械师. One of the 少校 differences was that there were now two Blue 突袭 Points (as opposed to 2016 where there was only one) and three Red 旗子 (as opposed to 2016 where there was only one). This amendment proved to be extremely influential. Now, the Red 团队 was no longer majorly disadvantaged. Now, Blue had to coordinate their defenses as well. Blue required to spread their defenses equally so that neither fort could be infiltrated. Additionally, the entire 地图 was three times larger than its 2015/2016 counterpart. Due to this, the Red base was enlarged to accommodate new spawn 职务 to better suit the new layout of the Red base. Drop 动感区域 were also changed to better suit strategic purposes and the 地图 could now harbor 30 玩家, or 15v15 战斗 (as opposed to the previous year where only 24 玩家 could participate, or 12v12 战斗). The addition of two more 旗子 proved to be extremely required, as sabotage cases dramatically reduced - there was less fighting for 旗子职务. This 地图 supported 团队对战, 死亡混战, and 突袭战斗. The 地图 itself was absolutely stunning. The<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="./Skyboxes">Skybox</a>was breathtaking, as well as the overall aesthetic of the 地图. A full Spectator view of the 地图 can be seen below:<br>
</p><figure class="mw-halign-center" typeof="mw:File"><span><img src="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/thumb/6/6a/NY_2016.17_spec.png/450px-NY_2016.17_spec.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="281" class="mw-file-element" srcset="https://en.tankiwiki.com/images/en/6/6a/NY_2016.17_spec.png 1.5x"></span><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><br>
</p><p>In order to succeed in 突袭模式, it is best for the Blue 团队 to not return the 旗子, as no 经验值 can be gained from it nor will it benefit the 团队, unless of course, another attacker is about to pick up the 旗子. It is best to leave the 旗子 so that the Red 团队 has to wait longer to get the 旗子 and launch another attack. Raiding the Red base can also be useful, to slow the Red 团队’s attacks down. When the update was initially released, the 地图’s 机械师 had to be changed. On the 26th of December, the 地图 was slightly modified to 允许 for 30 玩家 to play in 15v15 战斗 (instead of 24, 10v10). Additionally, capturing a 旗子 for the Red 团队 was reduced to 3 团队 points (from the previous 5 points per capture) as there were complaints that attacking the Red 团队 was too easy. Blue gained a standard one-团队 point every ten seconds, meaning that the 战斗 was a race against the clock, where the Red 团队 needed to stay ahead of Blue in terms of 战斗分数 in order to win. 金箱子 which dropped in the 地图 had unique 金箱子 sirens, which sounded like this:<br>
